1. Make sure you are getting BlackPill (STM32F411) v3.1.
2. You should get the optional 8 MB or 16 MB Flash chip pre-soldered to the bottom of the board.
3. Some retailers will sell the BlackPill board with the headers pre-soldered.
4. Also, from your favorite retailer, I suggest you acquire a "ST LINK-V2" dongle.
